“Visualizing shortest-path algorithms, one terminal frame at a time.” ✨

📝 Project Description

This project is a terminal-based maze pathfinding visualizer built using Python and the Curses library.
It demonstrates how the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm explores a maze level by level to guarantee the shortest path from a start point to a destination.

The maze is rendered dynamically in the terminal, allowing users to visually observe:

Visited nodes

Active exploration

Final shortest path discovery

This project is ideal for learning algorithms, debugging pathfinding logic, and showcasing DSA skills in a visual and intuitive way.
